Describe your algorithm design for each of the following challenges. This can or can not include using certain data structures. Think about additional questions that may require you to change the system!

- How would you build a system that stores and manages the hierarchy of an organization.
- Build the functionality to allow for undo and redo. Think of this feature like what you’ve used in a text editor or word processor.
- If you were building a game of Snake, what would be an optimal data structure for the snake?
- Write a system that accepts a string of HTML and validates it.
- A numeric array of length N is given. We need to design a function that finds all positive numbers in the array that have their opposites (a number that when added results in 0) as well.
- Build a game of tug of war. You should be able to add players to both teams.
- You’re building the system at McDonalds for managing your order.
- Design a simple calculator that can handle addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
- Build a game of Rock paper scissors. How could you build a system that scales to hundreds of option options (Spock, Lizard, fire, water, etc.)
- You need to design a system that can schedule tasks at different times.
- Now that you have designed the scheduler, a number of the tasks need to wait for some -her tasks to complete prior to running themselves. 
- How would this change your system?
- Merge k sorted arrays, Given k sorted arrays of size n each, merge them and print the sorted output.
- Given a map of the United States, and N number of colors, figure out all the ways each -ate can be colored as long as no two bordering states have the same color.
- Given a chessboard of N*N, how many different ways can you arrange the board so that N number of queens can be placed without attacking each other vertically, horizontally or diagonally.
- Design the pseudocode for a Minesweeper game
- Design a game of battleship, how would you lay out the board?
- Create a system that allows for scheduling events on a calendar for available dates.
