- What is Big O Notation?  
Big O Notation is a form of measuring runtime of a function as the input scales. It considers only the worst case scenario.

***
- What is the call stack?  
It's a system of executing functions that call other functions within them. When a function ends it is popped of the stack, giving the outer function the value it needs to continue to run. It is a key part of the event loop cycle and async cycle.
 
***
- What is a base case?  
The base case is a part of recursion that returns a value that is to be used in evaluating the rest of the recursive stack.

***
- What is the difference between time and space complexity?  
Time complexity tracks how the number of operations change as the input scales where space complexity tracks the amount of memory that is utilized as the input scales.

***
- What are some advantages/disadvantages to using Linked Lists versus arrays?  
Arrays shouldn't be used to implement a queue because they can only add or remove from the right side in O(1) time. Arrays have O(N) lookup, whereas linkedlists don't.

***
- What is the difference between a tree and a graph?  
A tree has a root whereas a graph does not. Graphs can be cyclical whereas trees cannot.

***
- What is the difference between a binary search tree and binary tree?  
A binary search tree is ordered in a way where the left branch holds lower values and the right branch holds higher values. Binary trees aren't ordered.

***
- What are graphs used for?  
Graphs can be used for mapping applications.


***
- What are trees used for?  
  - Org charts
  - Flight maps
  - Implementing heaps

	- Queues, Stacks
